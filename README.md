# Detecting cancerous lung nodules using a Convolutional Neural Network for an embedded devise
This project aims to create an automated detection system for cancerous lung nodules that can use tomography slices as inputs and predict whether or not there are cancer detected in that nodule. 
That will then be transfered to an embedded system for mobile use in third world countries.
